# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard 🚀

This project is part of my capstone coursework, where I applied skills learned during my academic journey, including SQL and Tableau. It demonstrates my ability to analyze and visualize data through interactive dashboards tailored for strategic decision-making.

## Dashboard Overview 📊

The project consists of three primary dashboards: **Summary**, **Overview**, and **Detail**, each designed with custom self-created backgrounds for a seamless and professional aesthetic. These dashboards enable data-driven decision-making through clear, interactive visuals and comprehensive insights.

**Dataset:**  
The dataset used in this project contains loan-related data, including borrower details, loan amounts, repayment history, and loan statuses. This dataset is the foundation for calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) and generating visuals.

**Query Document:**  
A meticulously crafted **Query Document** is attached, which:  
- **Documents All Queries**: Outlines each query used for metrics and visuals in detail.  
- **Ensures Accuracy**: Demonstrates how values are calculated and validated.  
- **Supports Traceability**: Ensures that every data point in the dashboards is reliable and transparent.
